# Advanced Natural Language Processing (CS11-711)

Solutions of the assignments

## Course objectives
* Describe fundamental tasks in natural language processing.
* Describe modern approaches to solve these tasks.
* Identify weaknesses and strengths of the proposed approaches.

## Assignment-01 (Minimal Neural Network Toolkit)
* Implementing the base `Tensor` class.
* Implementing differentiable operations for the `Computational Graph`.
* Implementing `Momentum Training` feature for the optimizer.
* Classification head and training loop provided in the skeleton code.

## Assignment-02 (Minimal BERT Implementation)
The main implementations is related to the `Transformer` architecture.
* Implementing the `self-attention` head.
* Implementing the `normalization` layer.
* Implementing the `multiheaded` attention `forward` layer.

## Final Project
This part is a replication of a scientific paper and will be provided in later work.
